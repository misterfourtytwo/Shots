**How to play?** One player reads out cards. All other players have to drink based off of what the card says. Those who fail to do so are out of the game. See the images below for a clearer explanation.

## 📝 FAQs
1. What is this game?

    In short, it aims to get you closer to your friends through a series of interesting questions and challenges. It's intended to be played in a party setting (and with drinks of course!). There are different card packs to choose from (Basic, NSFW, Challenges, and Developer).

2. How do I play?
     - Click play and choose your card packs
     - Click "Done"
     - Start swiping the cards!

3. Can I add or suggest more cards?

    Yes. Stay tuned for further information.

4. I'm not an adult 😐, how do I play?

    Change the rules! Instead of taking a sip, do a sit-up. Instead of taking a shot, do a push-up!

## 🛠 Build setup
Your system requires the Flutter SDK. Follow the steps here to [install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) it on your system. After Flutter is installed, clone or fork this repository.

Once Flutter has been set up, run the app with

```
flutter run
```

The main app entry point is `main.dart`, then `app/app.dart`.

**Note**: I highly recommend you to run the debug version of the app on a physical device instead of an emulator. The card swiping action and animations are more smooth on actual devices.

### Generating icons and splash screens
After updating `pubspec.yaml`, run these commands:
```
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
flutter pub pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

### Editing `router.dart`
Everythime you change `router/router.dart`, you need to run

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Build Android APK and appbundle
```
flutter build appbundle
flutter build apk
```

It is possible that the app is on your Android device, but not fully installed. To delete it completely, connect your device to your computer, and run the following command:

```
adb uninstall com.themindstorm.shots
```

Once the APK has been built, install it on a physcally connected Android device:
```
flutter install
```

In the production app, I was getting `ClasscastException at FlutterSplashView.java`. This [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61075984/getting-classcastexception-at-fluttersplashview-java-for-one-of-my-published-app) helped.

## 😲 Explanation

Check out my flutter package [swipeable_widget](https://github.com/ninest/swipeable_card) to use the swiping cards in your own app.

### How does the card swiping work?
Firstly, the `Draggable` widget was not used. While it is great, it does not support animating the child back to the original position when it is not dragged to the drop zone.

Instead, the method od animating the alignment by moving it to the finger position was adopted. When the child is dropped, it can be animated back to the center (`Alignment.center` in this case). See this [guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/animation/physics-simulation).

### Steps
#### 1. Card tapped/panned down:

`controller.stop()` is called.

#### 2. Card is being panned/dragged around:

The position of the widget is being updated (`ShotCard` is a stateful widget).

```
setState(() {
  _dragAlignment += Alignment(
    // scroll sensitivity
    details.delta.dx * 3 / (size.width / 2),
    details.delta.dy * 3 / (size.height / 2),
  );
});
```

*From here on, multiple actions can take place with `onPanEnd`*:

#### 3a. The card is dropped

`_runCardBackToCenterAnimation()` is called. This function animates the `ShotCard` from its current position to `Alignment.center`.

#### 3b. The card is dropped *at the side*

When the card is dropped at the side of the screen, it means the user wants to 'dismiss' it and see the next one.

*If they're playing any game, it means that they want to discard the card and see the next one.*

We can check if the card is dropped at the side by looking at `_dragAlignment.x`:

```
if (_dragAlignment.x > 0.85) {
  _runCardLeaveAnimation();
  Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: _animationDuration + 100)).then((_) {
    setState(() {
      _dragAlignment = Alignment.center;
    });

    // getting next card ...
    final CardProvider cardProvider = Provider.of<CardProvider>(context, listen: false);
    cardProvider.nextCard();
  });
}
```

**What seems to be happening?**
- The card is discarded (gone)
- Next card comes into focus


**What actually happens?**
This is what's going on under the hood.

1. The card is animated out of the screen with `_runCardLeaveAnimation()`.
2. There is a slight delay (sleep). This delay **must** be more than the `_animationDuration`.
3. After the delay, the card is moved back to the center **without any animaton**.
4. Using state management to set the shot card to show the next card.

In step 2, a delay is necessary to take into account the time taken for the animation. The delay also must be higher than the animation delay. If not, then the following will happen at the same time (we don't want this):
- Animating the card out of the screen, and
- Putting the card in the center without animation.

The 'current card' that you see (on top of the others) never changes. Only it's **color**, **text**, and **rotate angle** changes, giving the appearance that it's gone and the next one is showing.
